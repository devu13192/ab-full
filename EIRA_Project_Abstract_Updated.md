# AI-Powered Mock Interviewer for Performance Analysis (EIRA)

## 1. Introduction

Job interviews are essential in shaping a candidate's career, yet many aspirants struggle due to limited access to personalized mock interview practice. Human-led mock sessions are helpful but resource-intensive and inconsistent.
