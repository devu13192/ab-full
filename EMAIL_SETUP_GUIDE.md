## üß™ Testing the Email System

   - Check that SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS are set
   - Restart your server after changing .env

2. **"Authentication failed" error:**
   - Use App Password, not your regular Gmail password
   - Make sure 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account
   - Check that the app password is correct (16 characters, no spaces)

3. **Emails not being sent:**
   - Check server console for error messages
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check Gmail's "Less secure app access" (not needed with App Passwords)

4. **Emails going to spam:**
   - This is normal for automated emails
   - Add your email to contacts
   - Check spam folder

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check if .env file exists
ls -la backend/.env

# Check environment variables
cd backend
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log('SMTP_USER:', process.env.SMTP_USER); console.log('SMTP_PASS:', process.env.SMTP_PASS ? 'Set' : 'Not set');"

# Test email connection
node test-email-notifications.js
```

## üìä Email Analytics

The system logs all email activities:

```
‚úÖ Welcome email sent successfully to user@example.com
‚úÖ Deactivation email sent successfully to user@example.com
‚úÖ Activation email sent successfully to user@example.com
‚ùå Failed to send email: Authentication failed
```

## üé® Customization

### Modify Email Templates:

Edit the email templates in `backend/controllers/users.js`:

- `sendLoginEmail()` - Welcome and login notifications
- `sendDeactivationEmail()` - Deactivation notifications
- `sendActivationEmail()` - Activation notifications

### Customize Styling:

The HTML templates use inline CSS for maximum compatibility. You can modify:
- Colors and gradients
- Fonts and spacing
- Layout and structure
- Content and messaging

## üöÄ Production Considerations

### For Production Use:

1. **Use a dedicated email service:**
   - SendGrid
   - Mailgun
   - Amazon SES
   - Or keep Gmail with proper rate limiting

2. **Set up proper error handling:**
   - Log failed emails
   - Implement retry logic
   - Monitor email delivery rates

3. **Comply with email regulations:**
   - Include unsubscribe links
   - Follow CAN-SPAM guidelines
   - Respect user preferences
